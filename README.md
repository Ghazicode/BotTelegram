This is a JavaScript Telegram bot that we can send a file to and give it mandatory member channels, and then the bot will give you a link that you can send to others, and when they click on that link, they must join the channels, and when their membership is confirmed, the files will be sent to them.


<h2>Note that when you give a bot a mandatory membership channel link, the bot must be an admin of that channel.</h2>

<h2>commands:</h2>
<h4>newpost:</h4><p>To add a new post</p>

<h4>addfile:</h4><p>When you have sent your posts to the bot and you want to add another post to those posts again, we need to use this command.</p>

<h4>done:</h4><p>We use this command when we are done sending posts.</p>
